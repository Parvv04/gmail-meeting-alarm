# Usage üñ•Ô∏è

1. **Start the backend (FastAPI):**
~~~
python3 src/main.py
~~~
2. **Start the Electron desktop app:**
~~~
npm run electron
~~~
3. Use the UI to:
   - Start/stop monitoring
   - Set allowed mail IDs, scan interval, and alert time
   - View detected meetings and logs
   - Click "View Email" to open the original Gmail message in your browser
   - Click "Join Meeting" to open the meeting link

**Note:**
- You must have a web browser installed for "View Email" to work. Electron will use your system's default browser.
- On Linux, ensure `xdg-utils` is installed (usually by default) and at least one browser (e.g., Firefox, Chromium).

---

# Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

You can modify these parameters in the UI or in `src/config.json`:
- Allowed sender email addresses
- Scan interval (minutes)
- Alert before meeting (minutes)
- Meeting keywords

---

# Troubleshooting

- **No notifications?**
  - Check your system's notification settings.
  - Ensure emails contain the keywords set in the UI.
- **Links not opening?**
  - Make sure you have a browser installed and set as default.
  - On Linux, install `xdg-utils` and a browser (e.g., `sudo apt install firefox`).
- **Backend not reachable?**
  - Make sure `python3 src/main.py` is running and accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

# Security üîí
